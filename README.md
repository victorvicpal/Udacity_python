# Udacity_python

I'm currently finishing my PhD in data science and I was planning to submit an application for [Data Science for Social Good](https://dssg.uchicago.edu/)
this summer. It's a really exciting Summer Fellowship organized by the University of Chicago (I'm looking forward to attend).
The application is currently online (deadline 01/31/2017).

**How can I be sure that I am eligible?**

Well, requirements are not really stringent. But there's an important requirement that I didn't fulfill :( "Programming in ```Python```".

Since I started my PhD ```R``` have been my program language.

I was really sad at the beginning cause I was expecting to apply. I almost threw in the towell, but a friend of mine told me:

> You have the skills. If you want something, at least you have to try.

And I enrolled the [Intro to Computer Science](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101) course that [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
offers for free. I felt in love immediately with the course. It's easy to understand and it allows you to skip the parts that you already know.

I've started 11 days ago and this is my final project: **A Gaming Social Network**

My next goal is to start the [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170) course and learn more
about ```NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib```

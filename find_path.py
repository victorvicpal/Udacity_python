# find_path_to_friend(network, user_A, user_B): 
#   Finds a connections path from user_A to user_B. It has to be an existing 
#   path but it DOES NOT have to be the shortest path.
#   
# Arguments:
#   network: The network you created with create_data_structure. 
#   user_A:  String holding the starting username ("Abe")
#   user_B:  String holding the ending username ("Zed")
# 
# Return:
#   A list showing the path from user_A to user_B.
#   - If such a path does not exist, return None.
#   - If user_A or user_B is not in network, return None.
#
# Sample output:
#   >>> print find_path_to_friend(network, "Abe", "Zed")
#   >>> ['Abe', 'Gel', 'Sam', 'Zed']
#   This implies that Abe is connected with Gel, who is connected with Sam, 
#   who is connected with Zed.
# 
# NOTE:
#   You must solve this problem using recursion!
# 
# Hints: 
# - Be careful how you handle connection loops, for example, A is connected to B. 
#   B is connected to C. C is connected to B. Make sure your code terminates in 
#   that case.
# - If you are comfortable with default parameters, you might consider using one 
#   in this procedure to keep track of nodes already visited in your search. You 
#   may safely add default parameters since all calls used in the grading script 
#   will only include the arguments network, user_A, and user_B.
